## Commands

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev                # http://localhost:5173, HMR
pnpm build              # SSR build → build/client + build/server
SSR=false pnpm build    # static / SPA build → build/client only
pnpm preview            # serve the static build locally (4173)
pnpm typecheck          # react-router typegen && tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint               # eslint
pnpm test               # vitest run
pnpm test:watch         # vitest in watch mode
```

OCI image (Nix-built, no Dockerfile): `nix build .#dockerImage && docker load < result && docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 d3strukt0r/wundexpertinplus:latest`.

TypeScript 6 and 7 run side by side, so don't collapse the two aliased devDependencies into one. `@typescript/native` *is* TypeScript 7 and owns the `tsc` binary that `pnpm typecheck` executes; the `typescript` entry is aliased to `@typescript/typescript6` so everything importing the `typescript` *module* gets a 6.x API — typescript-eslint via `@iwf-web/eslint-coding-standard`, plus `@react-router/dev` (peer `^5.1.0 || ^6.0.0`). TypeScript 7.0 deliberately ships no programmatic API (it arrives in 7.1), so a plain `typescript@7` makes `pnpm lint` crash on module load. The 6.x compiler stays reachable as `tsc6`, and `pnpm peers check` reporting an unmet `typescript` peer is expected, since peers match by package name while the alias resolves to `@typescript/typescript6`.

## Maintenance rules for agents

1. **Keep this file current.** When you change the build pipeline, add or remove a Vite plugin, change how `SITE_HOST` / env vars flow, change CI workflow inputs or outputs, or introduce a new config module, update the relevant section here in the same change set. Don't leave it lagging "for later".
2. **Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` before declaring a task done.** Both must exit 0. A passing `pnpm build` is not enough — lint catches the `Buffer`-without-import / nullish-conditional / unused-arg class of bugs that Vite silently builds past. Fix them in the same change set, not in a follow-up.

## Architecture

### Dual-mode build is the central design fork

`react-router.config.ts` reads `process.env.SSR`. Default is SSR (Node host, Docker). GitHub Pages has no Node runtime, so `deploy-gh-pages.yml` sets `SSR=false`, which produces a pure SPA in `build/client/`. CI runs both builds.

There are no server actions in this site — it's content-only with `tel:` / `mailto:` links and a client-side Google Map. If you ever add a server `action()` to a route, you'll need to wire in a SPA-build export stripper (see the `weleda-webcenter-text-export` repo for a reference implementation).

### Routing

Two routes: `routes/home.tsx` (one-page site: Hero / Leistungen / Über mich / Kontakt) and `routes/not-found.tsx` (`*` 404 fallback). The 404 renders Nav, centered title + message + back-home `<Link>`, and a green-panel Footer pinned to the viewport bottom via `flex-col min-h-dvh`. ErrorBoundary in `root.tsx` uses the simpler `<FallbackLayout>` (no Nav/Footer — Nav might be what's broken).

In-page anchors (`#leistungen`, etc.) drive section navigation. Nav targets come from `de.yml` as absolute path-with-hash (`/#kontakt`), so they SPA-navigate correctly from any route. React-router doesn't auto-scroll to hash on push, so `<ScrollToHash />` in `root.tsx` listens for `location.hash` and calls `scrollIntoView()`. `<ScrollRestoration getKey={(loc) => loc.pathname + loc.search} />` keeps hash-only navigations from resetting scroll to 0.

### Theme system

`useTheme` returns `[theme, setTheme]`. Sets `html.light` / `html.dark` for CSS variable cascades. Persists to `localStorage['wundexpertinplus:theme']` and falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`. An inline `themeBootstrap` IIFE in `root.tsx` runs in `<head>` (before stylesheets evaluate) so the first paint matches the stored choice — no FOUC and no cross-fade animation. The same IIFE adds `html.js` — see the no-JS section below for what that gates. The class is on `<html>` (not `<body>`) so the script can run during head parsing, before `<body>` even exists.

If JS is disabled, `<html>` has neither `.light` nor `.dark`. The `dark` mixin in `_tokens.scss` emits both `html.dark { ... }` and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) html:not(.dark):not(.light) { ... }`, so the OS preference still drives the palette without JS.

The **Kontakt** section is intentionally dark-green in both modes — its CTAs reference `--green-fixed` / `--paper-fixed`, not the themed `--green` / `--paper` tokens.

### Progressive enhancement (no-JS path)

The site renders correctly with JavaScript disabled. Several conventions enforce this:

- **`html.js`** is added by the `themeBootstrap` IIFE before hydration. Use it as a CSS gate for anything whose *default* should be the final/visible state: e.g. `.reveal` defaults to opacity 1 / no transform; `html.js .reveal:not(.is-shown)` is what hides it pre-scroll-trigger (`_animations.scss`). Without JS, IntersectionObserver never runs, so without this gate every reveal would stay hidden forever.
- **Tailwind `no-js:` variant** (`tailwind.css:67`) is a `@custom-variant` matching `html:not(.js)` — use it to hide controls that are dead without JS (theme toggle, scroll-to-top button).
- **Mobile menu** is a hidden `<input type="checkbox">` + `<label>` + `:has(.site-nav__toggle:checked)` — works without JS via native label-for-input. React tracks `open` via the input's `onChange` (for aria-expanded and hashchange-close). **Don't add `onClick` on the label** — the native synthetic click is what we want. The hidden-checkbox styling is just utilities on the input (`absolute w-px h-px opacity-0 pointer-events-none`), not a class rule.
- **Anchor-link header offset** uses `scroll-margin-top` on each section target (`#home`, `#leistungen`, `#ueber-mich`, `#kontakt`) in `_base.scss`, **not** `scroll-padding-top` on `<html>`. Container-level scroll-padding triggers Chrome's "scroll focused element into view" routine when the hidden menu checkbox gains focus, causing a visible page-jump on every menu toggle.

### Accessibility (global media-query overrides)

Two universal-selector blocks in `_base.scss` handle user preferences automatically — anyone adding a new effect doesn't need to remember the override:

- **`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`** nulls every animation/transition to 0.01ms (so `transitionend` / `animationend` listeners still fire), forces `animation-iteration-count: 1`, and sets `scroll-behavior: auto`. `!important` overrides Tailwind utility specificity. One rule covers every CSS transition, every `@keyframes` animation, and every Tailwind `transition-*` / `animate-*` / `duration-*` utility regardless of where they're declared.
- **`@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce)`** overrides `--header-bg` to its solid sibling (light: same hue as `--map-bg`; dark: same as `--bg`), then disables `backdrop-filter` everywhere. Subtle borders (`--line` alpha 0.14/0.16) and shadows (`--shadow-soft`) are left alone — they're depth cues, not content-readability translucency.

### Styling

**Tailwind v4 is the primary styling system.** Utilities are colocated with markup; SCSS is reserved for what utilities can't express. `main.scss` is a short `@use` index:

```
app/styles/
  tailwind.css          @theme block (non-color tokens) + @theme inline (--color-* aliases) + @utility (container, duration-theme, duration-reveal, transition-drawer) + @custom-variant (dark, no-js)
  main.scss             @use index for the SCSS files below
  _mixins.scss          @mixin dark (top-level) + @mixin in-dark (nested with &) — both emit html.dark + no-JS prefers-color-scheme fallback
  _tokens.scss          oklch + motion CSS variables on :root, with @include dark { ... } for the dark cascade
  _base.scss            resets, scroll-margin targets, body bg-only transition, per-utility @layer base theme-transition rule, global reduced-motion + reduced-transparency overrides
  _animations.scss      html.js .reveal:not(.is-shown) gate only (transition lives on <Reveal>)
  _brand.scss           SVG brand-mark theme overrides (need higher specificity than the SVG's inline <style>)
  _nav.scss             :has(.site-nav__toggle:checked) morph rules + burger span transition
  sections/_hero.scss   portrait blob filter
  sections/_map.scss    map placeholder shimmer
```

Whole SCSS surface is ~430 LoC across 8 files. Everything else is utilities on the JSX.

**Design tokens** (`_tokens.scss`) are `oklch()` CSS variables on `:root` (light) with dark overrides emitted via `@include dark { ... }` (covers both `html.dark` and the no-JS `prefers-color-scheme` fallback). No hex / rgb / hsl anywhere in the SCSS (or in inline SVG fills). `tailwind.css` mirrors these as `--color-*` tokens inside `@theme` so utilities like `bg-paper`, `text-ink-soft`, `border-line` resolve via `var()` and follow the cascade at use-time. The `--color-*` aliases are declared ONLY at `:root`; redeclaring them inside the dark cascade is redundant because `var()` substitution happens at the consuming element's computed-value time.

**Motion tokens** (`_tokens.scss` + `tailwind.css`) — two named durations own every transition in the project. Tune feel here, not at call sites:
- `--theme-transition` (400ms) — dark/light colour crossfade for every themed surface (page bg, headings, text, buttons, dividers, brand SVG fill, ThemeToggle icon swap, MapBox tile fade) plus the same duration on every hover transition (buttons, links, burger morph). One knob owns "how slow does the theme feel". Tested at 200ms / 400ms / 4s / 8s — all behave identically, just scaled.
- `--reveal-duration` (700ms) — scroll-reveal entrance (`<Reveal>` fade + translateY).

Utility classes: `duration-theme` and `duration-reveal`. They're declared as explicit `@utility` blocks in `tailwind.css` — NOT as `@theme --duration-*` tokens. Tailwind v4 only mints `.duration-*` utilities from literal `<time>` values; a `var(--theme-transition)` reference is silently skipped (utility falls through to Tailwind's 150ms default, causing a 3-frame snap on theme flip).

The `prefers-reduced-motion` global override in `_base.scss` flattens both to 0.01ms regardless.

#### Theme crossfade mechanics

Three rules in `_base.scss` drive the crossfade:

1. **`body { transition: background-color var(--theme-transition) ease; }`** — body bg fades. `color` is **deliberately NOT in body's transition** because a `color` transition on body retargets every descendant's own `color` transition every frame against body's inherited animating colour, stalling them for the full window then playing back over a second window (~2× lag, visible as "icon stays bright while page goes dark, then quickly snaps at the end").
2. **`@layer base { :is(.bg-bg, .bg-paper, …, .border-line, …) { transition: background-color, border-color }; .text-bg, .text-ink, …, .text-cta-dot { transition: color, background-color, border-color } }`** — per-utility, property-split. The `:is(...)` block targets every themed `bg-*` / `border-*` utility class WITHOUT `color` in its transition. The `.text-*` block (later in source order so it wins the shorthand for elements with both) transitions all three properties. Elements that only set a themed bg/border (sections, headers) don't drag `color` through, so they don't stall their text descendants.
3. **`_brand.scss` `.brand-plaster__bg, .brand-plaster__strip-v { transition: fill … }`** — brand-mark SVG fills use **literal** `oklch(...)` values per theme rule (not `var(--…)`), so they need an element-level fill transition. Lives next to the `html.dark` / `html.light` rules that change those fills. **Do NOT add `transition: fill, stroke` on `body *`** — icon SVGs with `stroke="currentColor"` would retarget every frame against the parent's animating colour and lag ~8s.

Reveal-style entrance wrappers handle the conflict differently: `.reveal` declares the full transition explicitly in `_animations.scss` with per-property durations (opacity + transform at `--reveal-duration`, `border-color` at `--theme-transition`) — so the divide-line borders animate at theme speed even though the Reveal wrapper itself is on the entrance timing.

`[&_em]:text-green` (Tailwind variant on `<h1>` / `<h2>`) paints `color: var(--green)` on the descendant `<em>` via a child selector, with no transition declared. Adding `transition: color` to the em retargets against the heading's own `color` transition (~8s lag). Workaround in `_base.scss`:

```scss
[class*="[&_em]:text-green"] em {
  -webkit-text-fill-color: var(--green);
  transition: -webkit-text-fill-color var(--theme-transition) ease;
}
```

`-webkit-text-fill-color` is a different property than the parent's transitioning `color`, so Chrome doesn't retarget. `currentColor` doesn't trigger transitions (it's a keyword, not a typed colour value), so reference the variable directly.

Same idea, different element: `[&_strong]:text-ink` paints `color: var(--ink)` on `<strong>` (used inside `text-ink-soft` paragraphs). Same rule below the em one, with `var(--ink)`.

**Two dark-cascade mixins** in `_mixins.scss`:
- `@include dark { ... }` — **top-level** form. Use at root scope to declare a whole block of dark-mode rules (the token cascade, the reduced-transparency `--header-bg` override). Emits `html.dark { ... }` + the no-JS `prefers-color-scheme: dark` fallback.
- `@include in-dark { ... }` — **nested** form. Use INSIDE an existing rule when only that rule needs a dark variant. Emits `html.dark &` + the no-JS fallback with `&`.

**Don't write `html.dark` or `html.dark &` directly in SCSS** — both miss the no-JS path. Partials open with `@use 'mixins' as *;` (or `'../mixins'` from `sections/`).

#### Custom `@theme` tokens

`tailwind.css` extends Tailwind's namespaces with project-specific values:

- **Spacing** — `--spacing-hairline` (0.09375rem / 1.5px, burger lines), `--spacing-stack` (1.125rem / 18px, common rhythm), `--spacing-stack-lg` (1.375rem / 22px, wider rhythm). These half-step values aren't in Tailwind's dynamic spacing scale.
- **Typography** — `--text-micro` (0.625rem / 10px, eyebrow caps below `text-xs`). Font sizes/leading otherwise map to Tailwind defaults.
- **Tracking ladder** past `tracking-widest` (which tops at 0.1em) — `--tracking-eyebrow-tight` (0.14em), `--tracking-eyebrow` (0.18em), `--tracking-eyebrow-wide` (0.22em), `--tracking-eyebrow-widest` (0.3em). The uppercase eyebrow style across the site uses these.
- **Shadows** — `--shadow-card`, `--shadow-hover` reference `--shadow-soft` / `--color-shadow` so the light/dark cascade still flips them.
- **Easing** — `--ease-soft: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.7, 0.2, 1)`.

Two `@utility` declarations:
- `container` — custom max-width steps that reserve scrollbar width (so the container snaps at the breakpoint exactly, not 15px past it).
- `transition-drawer` — single-property `max-height` transition for the mobile drawer, ridden by `ease-soft`. Can't use Tailwind's bare `transition` (no max-height in the curated property list) and `transition-all` would animate the drawer's open-state borders (we want them to snap).

**Rule of thumb for new values:**
1. If close (≤10% drift) to a Tailwind default → use the default.
2. If it recurs and isn't close → add a `@theme` token.
3. Only fall back to arbitrary `[…]` for one-off non-design-system values (rotations, translates, complex `transition-[…,…]` property lists, `min-h-[2lh]`, complex `grid-cols-[…]`, elliptical `rounded-[X_/_Y]`).

### Brand mark and favicons

Single source of truth: `app/assets/brand/plaster-plus.svg`.

- **Inline in the page** — imported with `?react` in `Nav.tsx` as a React component, so theme overrides in `_brand.scss` (`html.dark .brand-plaster__bg { ... }`) can win over the SVG's inline `<style>` block via specificity.
- **Standalone favicon** — the `favicon-rasters` Vite plugin (`app/vite/plugins/favicon-rasters.ts`) emits the SVG copy plus PNG rasters plus a multi-resolution `favicon.ico` (via `png-to-ico`) into `build/client/` at build time. The SVG's inline `<style>` has `prefers-color-scheme: dark` rules so the browser-tab favicon renders correctly on its own.
- **CSS-class fills are inlined before raster** — libvips (sharp's SVG renderer) ignores external CSS rules, so a class-only SVG rasterises as all-black. The plugin walks the SVG's `<style>` block, parses the light-mode rules (skipping `@media` blocks), converts `oklch(...)` values to sRGB hex via `culori`'s `formatHex`, and injects them as inline `fill` / `stroke` / `opacity` attributes on every element with a matching `class="..."`. The browser-visible SVG copy (`/favicon.svg`) is the untouched original — only the buffer passed to sharp is rewritten.
- **PWA icons** (192/512 maskable) come from the same SVG, sizes declared in `app/config/web-manifest.ts`'s `WEB_MANIFEST_ICONS`. The `web-manifest` plugin emits `site.webmanifest` referencing the same paths, so the manifest icon list and the rasterizer's emit set stay in lockstep.

Nothing favicon-related is committed — it's all regenerated each build.

### Nav

- **Routing-aware** — menu links and the brand logo use **react-router `<Link>`**, not `<a>`. Hrefs are stored in `de.yml` as absolute paths-with-hash (`/#leistungen`) so SPA navigation works from any route. A bare `#leistungen` would make react-router resolve relative to the current pathname (`/test#leistungen` from `/test`).
- **Breakpoints** — mobile drawer below Tailwind's `lg` (1024px), full menu at ≥`lg`. LinkedIn icon is hidden 1024–1279px (`max-xl:hidden`) so the row doesn't crowd in the narrow-desktop range; shown ≥1280px alongside the phone CTA and theme toggle. In the mobile drawer, LinkedIn is a separate row below the phone CTA.
- **Burger morph** — base styles (block / width / height / bg / origin) live as utilities on each `<span>` in `Nav.tsx`. The `:has(.site-nav__toggle:checked)` rules in `_nav.scss` apply the transform/opacity that morphs the three lines into an X. The transition stays in SCSS (transform at `var(--theme-transition)`, opacity at half) — the burger's bg/color are themed and pick up the per-utility `@layer base` rule via the `bg-ink` class on each span.
- **Header (`.site-nav`) transition exception** — the header has `bg-header backdrop-blur-md border-b border-line` and no themed `text-*` of its own. A dedicated `.site-nav { transition: background-color, border-color }` rule outside `@layer base` overrides the per-utility shorthand to drop `color` — keeps the descendant ThemeToggle button + menu links from being stalled by an inherited-colour transition on their header ancestor.
- **Drawer** — base styles as utilities (`absolute top-full inset-x-0 max-h-0 overflow-hidden bg-paper transition-drawer lg:hidden`); the open rule (`:has(:checked) .site-nav__drawer { max-height + borders }`) stays in SCSS for the same `:has()` reason. `transition-drawer` is a custom `@utility` so we don't need arbitrary `transition-[max-height]`.

### Vite plugins

Three custom plugins live in `app/vite/plugins/`:

- **`favicon-rasters`** — described in *Brand mark and favicons*.
- **`web-manifest`** — emits `site.webmanifest` to the build root. Sources `name` from `app/locales/de.yml`'s `brand.name` so a single edit propagates to the PWA install title. Other fields (`short_name`, `description`, `theme_color`, `background_color`, `display`, icon list) come from `app/config/web-manifest.ts` — the same module `favicon-rasters` reads to know which PNG sizes to render. Theme/background colors are stored as precomputed sRGB hex because several Android launchers still can't parse `oklch(...)`.
- **`copyright-from-license`** — reads `LICENSE.txt`, exposes `__COPYRIGHT_YEARS__` and `__COPYRIGHT_HOLDER__` as build-time globals consumed by the footer copyright lines.

There is no `public/site.webmanifest` — the file is generated, not committed.

### Google Maps

`app/lib/google-maps.ts` exports only data — the two `mapTypeStyles` arrays, the praxis coords + Place FTID, and the API key (`import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`). Provide the key via `.env.local` for local dev (see `.env.example`) and via a repo secret in CI (`deploy-gh-pages.yml` passes it through). The key is origin-restricted by Google, so shipping it in the client bundle is safe; we still keep it out of source for easy rotation.

`MapBox.tsx` uses `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` declaratively: `<APIProvider>` → `<Map styles={…}>` → `<Marker>` + `<MapControl>`. APIProvider is mounted inside MapBox (only consumer — Kontakt section), so the Maps JS doesn't load until that section mounts. Theme flip swaps the `styles` prop directly — no `setOptions` effect. The SVG marker icon needs `google.maps.Size` / `Point` constructors, which only exist after the Maps JS loads; `useMapsLibrary('core')` gates the `<Marker>` render until then.

`gm_authFailure` (the global Google calls when the API key is invalid or the HTTP-Referer restriction rejects the origin, e.g. on localhost) is wired in a `useEffect` to flip a `failed` state and reveal the schematic SVG fallback. `APIProvider`'s `onError` covers initial load failures.

### i18n is mandatory for all UI strings

Every user-facing string lives in `app/locales/de.yml`. Components import `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` and call `t('key')`. The `meta()` export in `routes/home.tsx` calls `i18n.t(...)` directly because it runs outside React. Lists (`leistungen.items`, `about.creds`, `kontakt.perks`) are YAML arrays — read them with `t('key', {returnObjects: true})`.

Nav target hrefs in `de.yml` are absolute (`/#kontakt`), not bare hash (`#kontakt`) — required for SPA navigation from non-`/` routes.

**HMR for translations** — `app/i18n.ts` includes a Vite `import.meta.hot.accept('./locales/de.yml', …)` hook that calls `addResourceBundle` + `changeLanguage(currentLang)` on YAML edit, so translations hot-reload without restarting the dev server. The dev server still needs one full restart any time `i18n.ts` itself changes (the init runs under `if (!i18n.isInitialized)`). For a future multi-locale setup, switch to the array form — `accept(['./locales/de.yml', './locales/en.yml'], …)` — since vite's `accept` has no glob support.

### Path alias

`~` resolves to `app/` (in both `tsconfig.json` paths and `vite.config.ts` resolve.alias). Use `~/components/Foo` rather than `../../components/Foo`.

### YAML imports

`app/locales/*.yml` are loaded as ES modules through `@modyfi/vite-plugin-yaml`. The ambient `*.yml` declaration lives in `app/globals.d.ts`.

### Site hostname (`SITE_HOST`)

The deployed hostname is **not** stored in the repo, and how it's resolved differs by deploy target.

- **SPA (GitHub Pages):** `deploy-gh-pages.yml` queries `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages"` and exports both `SITE_HOST` and `BASE_PATH` for `SSR=false pnpm build`: a configured `.cname` → that host at the root (`BASE_PATH=/`); otherwise the `.html_url` host + project sub-path (`/<repo>/`). No longer fails on a null cname. `vite.config.ts` reads `process.env.SITE_HOST` (falls back to `localhost`) and `BASE_PATH`, bakes the (sub-path-aware) `https://${SITE_HOST}` URL into the static `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt` — each emitted by its own build plugin (`app/vite/plugins/{sitemap,robots}.ts`, via `this.emitFile`) only in SPA mode (gated on `SSR === 'false'`) — and sets Vite `base` + the React Router `basename` from `BASE_PATH` so assets and routing resolve under the sub-path.
- **SSR image:** no build-time host. `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt` are served as resource routes (`app/routes/{sitemap-xml,robots-txt}.ts`, registered only when SSR) that import each plugin's `render*` fn and resolve the host **per request** via `resolveSiteUrl` in `app/lib/site-url.ts`: explicit `SITE_HOST` env (e.g. set in a `compose` file) wins, else the `X-Forwarded-Host` / `Host` header, else the request URL host. `docker.yml` and `flake.nix` therefore no longer pass `SITE_HOST`.

For a one-off SPA build with a specific host, set `SITE_HOST=example.com SSR=false pnpm build`.

## Production image (Nix-built OCI)

**No Dockerfile.** Image produced by `flake.nix` via `pkgs.dockerTools.streamLayeredImage`, post-processed by `nix-utils`' `fixOciImageHistory` so layers show per-step Commands in Dive and Trivy stops flagging the synthetic `HEALTHCHECK` (DS-0026).

- **Build**: `nix build .#dockerImage` → `./result` is a docker-load-able tarball.
- **Runtime layout**: app lives at `/opt/wundexpertinplus/{build,node_modules,package.json}`. User `nonroot:65532`. CMD `react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js`. Healthcheck `curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/` every 30 s.
- **`pnpmDeps.hash`** is a fixed-output hash. Every lockfile change → new hash. First build with a stale hash fails with `specified: X / got: Y` — copy the `got` value in. `.github/scripts/bump-pnpm-hash.sh` automates the swap-to-fakeHash → read-`got:` → write-back cycle; `bump-pnpm-hash.yml` runs it on push.

## Workflows

- **`ci.yml`** — lint + typecheck + build + tests on every PR / push.
- **`deploy-gh-pages.yml`** — queries `gh api .../pages` and exports `SITE_HOST` + `BASE_PATH` (custom domain → root; else `html_url` host + project sub-path), runs `SSR=false pnpm build`, uploads via `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v5` → `actions/deploy-pages@v5` on push to `master`. No longer fails on a null cname — a project site at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` is supported via `BASE_PATH` (Vite `base` + RR `basename`).
- **`docker.yml`** — multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`, `riscv64`) Nix-built OCI image to Docker Hub. The image resolves its host at runtime (resource routes), so the build no longer reads the Pages domain.
- **`bump-pnpm-hash.yml`** — push-triggered when `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `package.json` changes; runs `.github/scripts/bump-pnpm-hash.sh` to refresh `pnpmDeps.hash` in `flake.nix`. Requires `GH_PAT`.
- **`release.yml`** — `googleapis/release-please-action@v5`. Manages `package.json` (`version`) + `flake.nix` (`version = "X.Y.Z"; # x-release-please-version`). Uses `GH_PAT`.

## Gotchas

- **The `themeBootstrap` IIFE in `root.tsx`** is intentionally minified to a single line so it parses inline before hydration (avoids the theme FOUC).
- **Google Maps API key is public-but-restricted.** It's ok in the client bundle because Google enforces HTTP-Referer restrictions on the key (whitelisted to the site's origins). Don't proxy it through a backend.
- **`pnpmDeps.hash`** — every `pnpm-lock.yaml` change needs a paired hash bump in `flake.nix`.
- **Don't reintroduce a `public/CNAME` file.** The host is resolved at build time from the Pages API (Settings → Pages → Custom domain, or the github.io project URL when none is set). Adding a checked-in `CNAME` would create two sources of truth that can drift, and GitHub Actions-mode deploys ignore the file anyway (only branch-publishing mode honors it).
- **Favicon raster colors need inline attrs, not classes.** If you add a new element to `plaster-plus.svg`, give it a `class="brand-plaster__…"` matching one of the existing rules so the inline-styles pass picks it up. New CSS classes without corresponding rules in the SVG's `<style>` block will rasterise black.
- **pnpm via Corepack** on host/CI. Production image bypasses Corepack — uses `pkgs.pnpm_10` at build time, ships zero pnpm at runtime.
- **Nav `Link` hrefs must include the leading `/`** (e.g. `/#kontakt`). Bare `#kontakt` makes react-router resolve relative to the current pathname.
- **i18n init is guarded by `isInitialized`.** Changing options in `i18n.ts` requires a full dev-server restart (HMR can't re-run init). YAML *content* changes hot-reload via the `import.meta.hot.accept` hook in the same file.
- **Don't write `html.dark` or `html.dark &` directly in SCSS** — use `@include dark { ... }` (top-level) or `@include in-dark { ... }` (nested) so the no-JS `prefers-color-scheme` fallback selector is emitted too.
- **Don't redeclare Tailwind `--color-*` aliases under `@include dark`** — they're already declared once at `:root` as `var(--paper)` etc., and `var()` resolves at the consuming element. Redeclaring is pure noise (empirically verified against the live page).
- **`--color-*` must be `@theme inline`, not regular `@theme`.** The regular block sometimes serves a stale alias through the chain during a transition (visible as text snapping mid-animation back to the old palette). `@theme inline { --color-ink: var(--ink); }` makes Tailwind emit `.text-ink { color: var(--ink); }` directly, no alias indirection.
- **Body MUST NOT transition `color`.** A `color` transition on body retargets every descendant's own `color` transition every frame → ~2× lag visible as "icon stays bright then snaps dark at the end". Only `background-color` on body. Color transitions are declared per element via the `@layer base` per-utility rule.
- **`@layer base` per-utility transition rule is property-split.** `:is(.bg-*, .border-*)` gets bg + border only; `.text-*` gets color + bg + border. Order matters: `:text-*` rule is LAST so elements with both `text-*` AND `bg-*` win the cascade and get the full transition list. Headers / sections / wrappers that only set `bg-*` / `border-*` don't drag `color` through and don't stall their themed text descendants.
- **`duration-theme` / `duration-reveal` are explicit `@utility` blocks, not `@theme --duration-*` tokens.** Tailwind v4 only mints `.duration-*` utilities from literal `<time>` values; a `var(--theme-transition)` reference is silently skipped and the utility falls through to Tailwind's 150ms default. Symptom: a class change to `duration-theme` makes themed properties snap in three frames instead of crossfading.
- **Don't put `transition: fill, stroke` on `body *`.** Icon SVGs use `stroke="currentColor"`; a per-element stroke transition on them retargets against the parent's animating `color` every frame, causing the visible "icon stays bright then snaps dark at the end" lag (~8s on a 4s transition). The brand-mark SVG fills get their own transition in `_brand.scss` because they use literal `oklch(...)` per theme — those literal-fill elements are the only ones that actually need a fill transition.
- **Tailwind's bare `transition` utility (and `transition-colors`) eats themed properties from the shorthand.** Reveal's `transition-[opacity,transform] duration-reveal` would drop `border-color` even though descendants need it for the divide-line animation. `.reveal` declares the full transition explicitly in `_animations.scss` with per-property durations. Same pattern for the Result panel in webcenter / similar wrappers — declare the multi-property transition in CSS, not via a Tailwind shorthand utility.
- **`[&_<child>]:text-<themed>` variants paint colour on a descendant but no transition.** Animating the descendant's `color` directly retargets against the parent's `color` transition. Workaround: paint via `-webkit-text-fill-color: var(--themed)` (different property than `color`, no retargeting) and transition that. See the em + strong rules in `_base.scss`.
